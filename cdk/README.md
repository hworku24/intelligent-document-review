# VERA CDK

AWS CDK infrastructure for the VERA project. See the [top-level README](../README.md)
for full deployment instructions and parameter customization.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the app.

## Deploy

From a fresh checkout, `npm run deploy` builds all packages (backend and CDK)
and deploys automatically. The review invoke-agent Lambda is compiled and
bundled from TypeScript by esbuild during synth, so it needs no separate build
step:

```
cd cdk
npx cdk bootstrap   # one-time per account/region
npm run deploy
```

> Note: `npm run deploy` uses the `review` AWS profile. If you use a different
> profile, adjust the `deploy` script in `package.json` (or deploy manually,
> see below).

## Manual step-by-step deployment

```bash
# Prepare the backend
cd backend
npm ci
npm run prisma:generate
npm run build

# Install CDK packages and deploy
cd ../cdk
npm ci
npx cdk deploy --require-approval never --all
```

## Other commands

- `npm run build` compile CDK TypeScript to js (run `npm ci` first)
- `npm run build:all` build backend + CDK (the invoke-agent Lambda is bundled by esbuild at synth time)
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` run the jest unit tests
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `npx cdk synth` emit the synthesized CloudFormation template
